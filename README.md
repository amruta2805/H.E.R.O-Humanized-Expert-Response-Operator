# H.E.R.O â€“ Humanized Expert Response Operator
This project is a Python-based personal voice assistant, similar to Alexa or Siri. It can recognize voice commands, perform tasks, and provide information in real-time. The assistant can open websites like Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn, fetch the latest news headlines, play music from a predefined library, and answer general queries using OpenAI. It uses speech recognition for input and text-to-speech (gTTS or pyttsx3) for responses, making interactions smooth and natural.

Features:

-Voice command recognition with microphone input

-News updates via NewsAPI

-Music playback from a custom library

-Intelligent responses with OpenAI
